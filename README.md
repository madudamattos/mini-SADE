# mini-SADE

Welcome to the mini-SADE project! This repository contains the implementation of a prototype system designed to assist in dermatological care at PAD-UFES, developed for the Programming II course.


## Documentation

The detailed instructions for this assignment are available in the file `Descrição TP-2 Etapa 1.pdf`.

## Test Cases

Test cases can be found in the `Casos` folder, and the corresponding answers are located in the `Respostas` folder.

## Usage

I left a folder for tests, so run the following command ./prog Casos/teste
When prompted for the database path, enter "entrada".

Now feel free to use the system for registration and queries!
